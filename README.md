Project Overview

Project Title: Retail Sales Analysis

Level: Beginner

Database: project_1

This project is designed to demonstrate pgSQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through pgSQL queries. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL.


# Objectives

1 : Set up a retail sales database: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.

2 : Data Cleaning: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.

3 : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.

4 : Business Analysis: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

# Project Structure

# A - Database Setup

1 : DataBase Creation : The project starts by creating a database named project_1.

2 : Table Creation : A table named retail_sales is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.



# B - Data Exploration & Cleaning

1 : Record Count - Determine the total number of records in the dataset.

2 : Customer Count - Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.

3 : Category Count - Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.

4 : Null Value Check & Delete  - Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.



# C - Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1 : Write SQL query to add Day_Time, Month_Name , Year_Name column .

2 : Write a SQL query to find unique categories.

3 : Write a SQL query to find most selling product category .

4 : Write a SQL query to find most selling product quantity .

5 : What is the total revenue by month  .

6 : What is the total quantity by moonth .

7 : Which month had largest COGS .

8 : What is the most product line by gender .

9 : What is gender is most customer.

10 : Which of the day of week has the best sales .

11 : Write a SQL query to retrive all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05'.

12 : Write a SQL query to retrive total sales  made on '2022-11-05'.

13 : Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales for each category . 

14 : Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from each category . 

15 : Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from beauty category.

16 : Write a SQL query to find all transections where total sales is greater then 1000.

17 : Write a SQL query to find the total no. of transections made by each gender in each category. 

# Findings

Customer Demographics - The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.


High-Value Transactions - Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.

Sales Trends - Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.

Customer Insights - The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

# Reports

Sales Summary : A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.

Trend Analysis :  Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.

Customer Insights :  Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

# Conclusion
This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to SQL for data analysts, covering database setup, data cleaning, 
exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive business decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
